# Redux_Intro

### Overview
I worked on this sample app while teaching myself _Redux_ and React .

### Technologies
* React, Redux, JavaScript
* Data Store
* Redux Toolkit
* Custom React Hooks (_useSelector, useDispatch_)
* Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
I learned how Redux libraries really simplifies our lives for implementing app-wide or cross-component state change. What's more, we can further eliminate "boiler plate" code by importing and implementing Redux Toolkit. This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
